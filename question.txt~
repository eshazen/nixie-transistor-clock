Hi Folks-

Thanks for the add!  I've built a couple of nixie clocks, first one
was in 2003 using B-5092 end view tubes scavenged from a non-working
laboratory scalar.  I used an AT90S1200 microcontroller, which was a
bit challenging since it has no RAM and thus all was in assembly
language.

Then I built a Kabtronics Nixie Transistor clock
(http://tube-clock.com).  This was a bit of an adventure, though it
did power up essentially trouble-free.  I'm curious if anyone here
built one of these and what their experience has been?  The HV power
supply died within a few weeks and after some fussing I replaced it
with a little DC/DC board design I found on OshPark.

My main complaint now is that it loses the time when the power fails
(of course) and setting is a real pain since there is no switch
debouncing.  I'm thinking of adding a "self-set" with an ESP8266 to
get the time over WiFi and reset the clock periodically.  The
challenge is that there isn't any obvious way to hook a uC into this
old-skool transistor logic circuit.

I thought I'd post here just in case someone else has attempted
anything similar, or has experience with the Kabtronics clock

Happy Hacking!
